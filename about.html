<h3 href="orig">Original Game</h3>
<p>
    The game is basically an upgrade chain. There are 5 basic classes of animals:<br>
    Rabbit, Sheep, Pig, Cow and Horse.
    At the beginning of each round, you can trade <b>once</b> (both ways). The exchange rates are the following:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Rabbits = 1 Sheep</li>
        <li>2 Sheeps = 1 Pig</li>
        <li>3 Pigs = 1 Cow</li>
        <li>2 Cows = 1 Horse</li>
    </ul>
   
    You can get animals by rolling two, 12 sided dices, each having a different layout.<br>
    If you roll two rabbits or sheeps or pigs; you earn 1 of that type. 
    Later, if you throw a rabbit, and you have one, the sum of what you have and what you threw (1 or 2) is halfed, rounded down and given to you.<br>
    <br><i>Example:</i> You have three pigs, a rabbit and one sheep. You throw a pig and a sheep. Therefore you get two pigs and one sheep.
    <hr>
    You can gain initially cows and horses only by trading, because there is only 1-1 of each animal in the dices.<br><br>
    <b>Beware</b> there is a fox on one and a wolf on the other dice.<br>
    If you throw a fox, all your rabbits will be gone; if you throw a wolf, all your livestock will be gone execept rabbits AND horses.<br>
    However, you can buy small dogs and big dogs; who will defend you <b>once</b> from their respective wild "partner". You can buy multiple dogs, and only one will die if a fox/wolf attacks.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Example:</i> You have seven rabbits a big dog and 4 pigs. You throw a wolf and a pig. Your big dog will automatically perish, but your pigs are saved and can breed that round; so you get 2 pigs.
    <br>Exchange rates for dogs are the following (you can either trade dogs or upgrade animals in one round!):
    <ul>
        <li>1 small dog = 1 sheep</li>
        <li>1 cow = 1 big dog</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    The ultimate goal is to have all livestock (not including the small and big dogs.)<br><br>

    <i>Example:</i> You have 30 rabbits, 2 sheeps, 3 pigs, a big dog and a horse. In every round, you trade first. You trade your big dog 1:1 to a cow, and win the game because you have 1 from every livestock.

<h3 id="impl">Implementation</h3>
<p>
    This is a 1:1 implementation of the game.
    Calling <code>createNewUser();</code> will create a new user.<wbr> Or simply hit the New Player button.<br><br>
    The value of each animal (measured in rabbits) is called <code title="constant [1,6,12,36,72,6,36]">values</code> <i>array</i><br><br>
    The upgrade cost for each livestock animal is stored in <code title="constant [6,2,3,2]">upgradeCost</code> <i>array</i><br><br>
    The sum and maximum amount of animals is stored in <code title="changes during game.">gameFieldHas</code> and <code title="constant [50,24,20,12,3,4,2]">gameFieldMax</code> <i>arrays</i> respectively.<br>
    <br><hr>
<h3 id="ai">Writing AI</h3>
    in your AI, yo can only call either of these functions once, or the AI will be reset.<br><br>
    <code>curr.ls(type,do)</code> Buys or sells livestock. <br><br><i>type</i> can be "rabbit", "sheep", ..., "horse". <i>do</i> can be either "buy" or "sell".<br><br>
    
    <code>curr.dog(size,do)</code> Buys or sells dogs. <br><br><i>size</i> can be "small" or "big".   <i>do</i> can be either "buy" or "sell".<br><br>
    
    <code>curr.wait()</code> <br><br>Does nothing, but dice will still be thrown as in .ls or .dog<br><br>
    
    <details>
        <summary><b>Alternatively, you can use the legacy (and number based) call function</b> (click to expand.)</summary>
         <br><br><code>curr.doRound(<i>what,which,where</i>)</code>
        function, where:
        <ul>
            <li><b>what</b> is the main action you want to do: 0 is nothing, 1 is trade, 2 is buying dogs</li>
            <li><b>which</b> is needed if you choose to do something in that round. 0=rabbit 1=sheep 2=pig 3=cow 4=horse. Or true=small dog false=big dog<br>
            </li><li><b>where</b> is whether you want to upgrade=true or downgrade=false. </li> 
        </ul>
        If an invalid function is called, it will just throw the dice, as if nothing was called.<br>
          
    </details><br>  
    
   <hr>
    the curr object has the following parameters <br><i>(Note that these values should be read only!)</i><br><br>
<li>
    <code title="example: [30,2,4,1,0,0,1]">curr.has</code> stores the amount of animal you have (including dogs) Stored in an <i>array[7]</i>.<br><br> Scheme: [rabbit,sheep,pig,cow,horse,smallDog,largeDog]<br><br></li>
    <li><code title="example: [2,1]">curr.diceResult</code> <i>array[2]</i> storing the results of the last dice.<br><br></li>
    <li><code title="example: 363">curr.topscore</code> is the sum points you have in all you livestock.<br><br></li>
    <li><code>curr.round</code> Which round is the AI/Player in. <br><br><i>If you try to throw dice twice in a function, the program will terminate the session.</i><br><br></li>
